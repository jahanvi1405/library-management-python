## 🧠 How It Works
- The program displays a menu-driven interface to the user
- Book records are stored in a CSV file (`library.csv`)
- Each operation (Add, Modify, Delete, Search) reads or updates the CSV file
- A temporary file is used while modifying or deleting records to ensure data safety
- The program runs in a loop until the user chooses to exit
